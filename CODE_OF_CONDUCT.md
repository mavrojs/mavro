# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of **mavro**, we are committed to fostering an open and welcoming community. We believe that simplicity, respect, and collaboration are essential for creating a great developer experience, and we expect all participants in our community to uphold these principles.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants as well as the steps to reporting unacceptable behavior.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, and inclusive environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in the **mavro** community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:
- Age
- Body size
- Disability
- Ethnicity
- Gender identity and expression
- Level of experience
- Nationality
- Personal appearance
- Race
- Religion (or lack thereof)
- Sexual identity and orientation

We are committed to ensuring that **mavro** remains a space where ideas are exchanged freely and respectfully, in line with our philosophy of simplicity and collaboration.

## Our Standards

We encourage behaviors that promote healthy and constructive collaboration:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Respecting different viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project.
- Showing empathy and kindness towards other contributors.

The following behaviors are unacceptable:

## Our Responsibilities

Maintainers of the **mavro** project are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces—such as issue trackers, codebases, mailing lists, Slack, and GitHub Discussions—and also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the core team at [o.nejdi@mavrojs.dev]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The core team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.
